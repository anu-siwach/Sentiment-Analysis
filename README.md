## Notes

Some challenges encountered during the project included:

- **Integrating Kafka with Hive:** Establishing a seamless connection between Kafka and Hive for real-time data ingestion and processing required careful configuration. Ensuring data consistency and managing potential latency issues were significant challenges.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling large volumes of unstructured data, including cleaning and normalizing text data for sentiment analysis, proved to be complex. Developing efficient preprocessing pipelines was crucial for maintaining data quality.

- **Sentiment Analysis Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy in sentiment classification was challenging due to the nuances in language, such as sarcasm, slang, and context. Fine-tuning the algorithm and selecting the right features were key to improving performance.

- **Scaling the Application:** Ensuring that the web application could handle large datasets and real-time sentiment analysis without performance degradation was a significant challenge. Optimizing the backend processes and managing resource allocation were essential.

- **User Interface Design:** Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the Streamlit application while displaying complex data in an easily understandable format required multiple iterations and user feedback.

These challenges provided valuable learning experiences and helped in refining both the technical and design aspects of the project.
